## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The basic use of position absolute property and the after pseudo-element,
this to achieve the active states for the share button.

### Continued development

Have a better understanding of semantic HTML and fluid typography.

Have better website layout building sense.

### Useful resources

-   [Why use rem instead of px](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCSw6bPXZks) - This taught me
    a new best practice for responsive design.

-   [Use of clamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erqRw3E-vn4&t=202s) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS clamp better. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
